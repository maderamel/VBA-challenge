    2. Create columns for the aforementioned data to be output into.

    3. Conditional format the Yearly Change values to display red if less than 0, and green if greater than 0. 

    4. Contain an additional display with the Ticker and Value for the Greatest % Increase, Decrease, and Total Volume.

    5. Loop across each worksheet.
